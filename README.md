## Description of the project
```
For this project we hope to demonstrate statisticl analysis on the Yelp Data set demonstrating a clustering analysis to make a sugestions for opening a business in a geographical reagin. 
```
## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers
```
Where should a person open a business based on these reviews in Yelp?
```
## Application of this knowledge
```
It was found that the most likely name of a business with a 5-star rating is ‘DDS’. This is a shorthand for doctor of dentistry in NV. It was also interesting that Food was found to be to top category in the area as well
